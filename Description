We all have done alot of discussion and then did our project (we have tried to distribute the work equally amoung us without any chaos),

The below given data is the details of our contribution:-

Arpita Prajapati - data collection and prepared the dataset (used kaggle),
Shivanshi Singh - wrote the whole source code in python idle (also uploaded to GitHub),
Sanju Kumar - collected the information on traffic through different platforms,
Shine Liju - finalised the tools we have used and ensure the correct libararies used,
Monish Undhad - made the README.md (which had all information).


Looking forward for some more intresting projects like this  :>
